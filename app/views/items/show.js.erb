// --- It is possible to have the modal appear instantly, with:

    // link_to item_path(item), {
    //         remote: true,
    //         "data-reveal-id" => "show-modal",
    //         "data-target" => "#modal-window"
    // }
//
// However it will show up before it is populated with the partial, so it's
// probably better to be explicit here, and only load it after
// rendering is complete.
